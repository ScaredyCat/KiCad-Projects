# KiCad-Projects

This contains all of my work-related KiCAD PCB designs, my related tools and files.

<H2>Libraries</H2>
This contains the files for any of the new schematics and footprints, including their 3D models that I've created.

<H2>Scripts</H2>
This contains any of the Python scripts I've created for use within KiCAD (all PCBNew-related since that seems to be the only module that supports scripting directly).

<H3>20_pixel_ring_WS2812B</H3>
This is a PCB design for a 20 pixel LED ring made from 5050 WS2812B (Neopixels as Adafruit calls them).  I got the idea from the Adafruit NeoPixel rings which come in the following sizes:  7, 12, 16, 24 and 60.  I made this ring to take advantage of the wasted space available on one of my other PCB projects.

<H3>30_pixel_ring_WS2812B</H3>
This is a PCB design for a 30 pixel LED ring made from 5050 WS2812B LEDs (Neopixels as Adafruit calls them).  I got the idea from the Adafruit NeoPixel rings which come in the following sizes:  7, 12, 16, 24 and 60.  I needed a slightly larger ring than the 24 pixel ring they make but not as large as the 60 for a project I was working on.

<H3>Nested_pixel_rings_WS2812B</H3>
This combines the 20 and 30 pixel rings into a single PCB file so I can have them both manufactured at lower cost (less wasted PCB space inside the rings).  Some fabs won't allow this but OSHPark seems to and they are reasonably sure their fab house will allow it.
